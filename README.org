#+title: Clicker Game
* Planetary Cycles
This idea is inspired from the planetary cycles found in western (or tropical) astrology.
** Objective
Conquer the solar system.

** Mechanics
In this clicker game, the points are *mana*, which represent magic. There are seven types of mana:

1. Mercury
2. Venus
3. Terra
4. Luna
5. Mars
6. Jupiter
7. Saturn

As time goes on, each planet moves along their orbit, moving in and out of each of the 12 zodiac signs.

Depending on the planet and sign, the mana for that planet increases (or decreases) at a particular rate, possibly along with other kinds of advantages (or disadvantages).

For example,

- Mercury in Libra:
  - Increase: Mercury gains 1 point every 5 hours.
- Venus in Scorpio:
  - Increase: Venus gains 2 points every 3 hours.

As the player accumulates mana for one planet, that planet "levels up," which unlocks various abilities and returns more mana.

When each planet is maxxed (level 10), the player has won the game.
